# Docker Compose

## What?
Docker compose is a tool for designing and running multi-container applications.

## Why?
Docker Compose is mostly used as a helper when you want to start multiple Docker containers and doesn't want to start each one separately using.

*For example, suppose you had an application which required NGNIX and MySQL, you could create one file which would start both the containers as a service without the need to start each one separately.*
